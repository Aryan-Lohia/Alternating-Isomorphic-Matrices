# Alternating Isomorphic-Matrices 

ASMCHECK - Input a matrix and find all possible row and column permutations and individual asm blocks

MAIN - Input order and number of -1s to find all possible combinations of a matrix with row and column sum=1 and alternating isometric matrices

This is a DSA project labeled, 
"Yukta Lodha (202021405), Isomorphism on Alternating Sign Matrices,  Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, MSc dissertation 2022"
under Yukta Lodha who formed the backbone of the project.\
The python project required a good control over DSA as well as Matrices in general.
It helped me gain insight on how problem solving is done at an industry level as I kept receiving updates on the problem statement and had to design a program to meet the needs of the problem.
